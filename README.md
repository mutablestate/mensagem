#mensagem

Elixir command line app that prints out various kinds of messages.

At the moment, it just prints out random quotes, like the Unix fortune app,
but in the future, it will also be used to print out reminders.

###Install

Download mensagem, change to the mensagem directory and run the following command:

    mix escript.build

###Use

At the moment, mensagem (with no arguments) only prints out random quotes.

###Status

Whatever the letter before alpha is :)
