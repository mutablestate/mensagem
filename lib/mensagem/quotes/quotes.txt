What sets worlds in motion is the interplay of differences, their attractions
and repulsions. Life is plurality, death is uniformity. By suppressing differences
and pecularities, by eliminating different civilizations and cultures, progress
weakens life and favors death. The ideal of a single civilization for everyone,
implicit in the cult of progress and technique, impoverishes and mutilates us.
Every view of the world that becomes extinct, every culture that disappears,
diminishes a possibility of life.

Today we all speak, if not the same tongue, the same universal language. There is no
one center, and time has lost its former coherence: East and West, yesterday and
tomorrow exist as a confused jumble in each one of us. Different times and different
spaces are combined in a here and now that is everywhere at once.

Technology is not an image of the world but a way of operating on reality. The nihilism
of technology lies not only in the fact that it is the most perfect expression

The North American system only wants to consider the positive aspects of reality.
Men and women are subjected from childhood to an inexorable process of adaptation;
certain principles, contained in brief formulas are endlessly repeated by the Press,
the radio, the churches, and the schools, and by those kindly, sinister beings,
the North American mothers and wives. A person imprisoned by these schemes
is like a plant in a flowerpot too small for it: he cannot grow or mature.
