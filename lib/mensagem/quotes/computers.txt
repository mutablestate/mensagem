There aren't enough swear-words in the English language, so now I'll
have to call you perkeleen vittupää just to express my disgust and
frustration with this crap.

I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself.
First Linux, now git.

Because if you want me to "act professional", I can tell you that I'm not
interested. I'm sitting in my home office wearing a bathrobe. The same way
I'm not going to start wearing ties, I'm *also* not going to buy into the
fake politeness, the lying, the office politics and backstabbing, the
passive aggressiveness, and the buzzwords. Because THAT is what
"acting professionally" results in: people resort to all kinds of really
nasty things because they are forced to act out their normal urges in
unnatural ways.
